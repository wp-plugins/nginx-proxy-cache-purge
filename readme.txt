== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What are the server requirements? =

[Nginx reverse proxy cache](http://wiki.nginx.org/) running with the [ngx_cache_purge](http://labs.frickle.com/nginx_ngx_cache_purge/) module installed.  I have published instructions at: [WordPress Nginx proxy cache](http://wpselect.com/blog/wordpress-nginx-proxy-cache/)

= How does this plugin work? =

After your publish or update a page or post this plugin creates a list or url's to purge.  For instance if the page is http://www.example.com/about/, the plugin creates a url of http://www.example.com/purge/about/.  After creating all the urls to purge, the plugin opens each of the urls.  It is critical that you have nginx configured with a location of /purge/.  You can manually purge a page by opening the purge url directly.
